# Plug n Play Tensorflow Object Detection API
[![TensorFlow 1.15](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-1.15-FF6F00?logo=tensorflow)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.15.0)

Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying
multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision.
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of
TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection
models. At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our
computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well. <p align="center">

Contributions to the codebase are welcome and we would love to hear back from
you if you find this API useful. Finally if you use the TensorFlow Object
Detection API for a research publication, please consider citing:
